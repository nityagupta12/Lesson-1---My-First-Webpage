     <h3>  3.  TEMPLE OF ARTEMIS AT EPHESUS.   </h3>

         Its purpose was to honor and worship the goddess Artemis,
          who was highly revered as the protector of Ephesus.

    <h3> 4. STATUE OF ZEUS AT OLYMPIA </h3>
    <p> Unfortunately, the Statue of Zeus has not survived to the modern era.
         It was destroyed sometime in the 5th or 6th century CE,
          either when Theodosius II ordered the temple destroyed,
           or by fire or earthquake after being moved to Constantinople.</p> <br>

           <h3> 5. MAUSOLEUM AT HALICARNASSUS </h3>
           <p> Halicarnassus' Mausoleum was a wonder due to its immense marble structures, 
            large dimensions, sculptures, architectural beauty, etc.
             The building featured various artistic achievements,
             including many relief sculptures and free-standing statues.</p> <br>

             <h3>6. COLOSSUS OF RHODES </h3>
             <p>The Colossus of Rhodes today only exists in historical records and legends from the Classical era. 
                There have been some initiatives to create a new structure in homage to the fallen colossus.
                 One such plan was a 60-to-100-meter light installation designed by German artist Gert Hof. </p> <br>

                 <h3> 7. LIGHTHOUSE OF ALEXANDRIA </h3>
                 <p> In 1303 A.D., another earthquake struck the region,
                     and the Lighthouse of Alexandria partially collapsed.
                      It was not restored fully, though historians suggest that minor repairs took place.
                       In 1323 A.D., the large remaining portion of the Lighthouse of Alexandria fell into the sea.</p>

<mark> Research suggests that exposure to nature,
    especially natural light,
     can reduce stress and anxiety levels. </mark>

   <code>  Watching the sunset can be a great stress reliever.
       Watching the sun set slowly behind the horizon can help you slow down,
        relax, and enjoy the beauty of nature, 
        which can help reduce your stress levels. </code>

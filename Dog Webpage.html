<h4>Highly intelligent, dogs have the capability of expressing their joy and happiness by wagging their tails.
     They are known to be the most loyal of animals. Dogs can sense your pain and can be your best friend.
      They can sense emotions, and when you are sad, they become sad and when you are happy, they are happy. </h4>

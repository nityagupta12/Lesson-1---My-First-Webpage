    The Burj Khalifa[a] (known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration) is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. 
    With a total height of 829.8m (2,722ft, or just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding antenna, but including a 242.6m spire)
    [2] of 828m (2,717ft), it is the world's tallest structure. 
    It has also held the record of the tallest building in the world since its topping out in 2009,
     surpassing Taipei 101, the holder of that status since 2004.[3][4]
